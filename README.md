# Joseph-MADA Project – Spring 2025
 
# Overview
This repository contains the materials and analysis workflow for my primary data analysis project, completed as part of the Spring 2025 MADA course. The project is developed using R, Quarto, and GitHub, with an emphasis on clear organization, reproducibility, and transparency in data processing, analysis, and reporting.

# Introduction
This study investigates the relationship between malaria episode frequency and adverse birth outcomes among pregnant women in Uganda. Specifically, it assesses whether the type of Intermittent Preventive Treatment in pregnancy (IPTp) regimen, either sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine (SP) or dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DP) modifies this association. Additionally, the study examines whether higher gravidity reduces the risk of adverse birth outcomes among women under the age of 25.

# Pre-requisites
To run the analysis and reproduce the results in this repository, you will need the following tools and software:

R and RStudio
Quarto for dynamic reporting
Git and GitHub for version control
A reference manager that supports BibTeX (e.g., Zotero with Better BibTeX extension)
A word processor (e.g., MS Word or LibreOffice)
Optional: A TeX distribution (e.g., TinyTeX) if you wish to render PDF outputs.







# Template structure and content

This repository follows a clear and organized folder structure to support a fully reproducible workflow:

The assets folder is a place for any files that do not belong in the data, code, results, or products folders. These items are not generated by code and may include schematics, images, .bib reference files, or citation style files.

The code folder contains all coding files required for the project. This includes scripts for data processing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), statistical analysis, and visualization. Subfolders may be added to organize scripts by analysis stage. You can view all scripts in the code folder here.

The data folder contains all data files required for the project. There are two subfolders:

raw-data: Contains raw data files obtained from source datasets.

processed-data: Contains cleaned and processed datasets used for analysis, including the merged project dataset (project_data.rds).

The products folder contains deliverables created from the analysis, such as reports, manuscripts, presentations, and supplementary materials.

The manuscript subfolder contains the main project report written in Quarto.

The slides subfolder contains presentation materials related to the project.

The results folder contains automatically generated outputs produced by the analysis code. This includes subfolders for:

Figures (.png files)

Tables (.png and .rds files)

Other analysis outputs
.rds files store reference-specific values used in the manuscript. .png files are displayed in the manuscript since Quarto currently cannot knit tables directly to Word format.

The README.md file provides an overview and instructions for the project (this file).

The .Rproj file defines the RStudio project workspace.

Hidden files (e.g., .gitignore, .Rprofile) are used for GitHub and RStudio configuration and can be ignored.



# Reproducibility Instructions
All required data files and scripts are included in this GitHub repository. To fully reproduce this project and its results, follow the steps below in the order listed:

1. processing_code.Rmd – Processes and cleans the raw data.
2. exploration.Rmd – Conducts exploratory data analysis.
3. analysis.Rmd – Performs statistical analysis on the processed data.
4. modeling.Rmd – Builds and evaluates statistical or machine learning models.
5. land_model.Rmd – Applies land model analysis (if applicable).
6. map_images.Rmd – Generates geographic visualizations and maps.
7. Manuscript.Rmd – Compiles the final manuscript report.
8. Supplement.Rmd – Compiles any supplementary materials.

Running these scripts in order will allow you to reproduce the full analysis workflow and outputs.
